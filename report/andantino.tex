\section{Andantino}

\subsection{Game Rules}
Andantino is a two player board game played on a 10x10 tile hexagonal board. The black player starts with a stone placed in the center of the board. The players take turns and stones can only be placed on tiles that share a border with at least two other occupied tiles (one other occupiedtile on the first move). A game is won once a player has reached either five connected tiles of his color in a straight line, or he has enclosed an arbitrary number greater than zero of enemy stones (and greater equal zero empty stone) with stones of his own.


\subsection{Game Characteristics}
With a total of 145 tiles, and a branching factor of only 2, Andantino lends itself to intelligent search algorithms. The game tends to give black an advantage by handing the black player the initiative from the start. However, with good play by white, draws and wins are well within reach for either player. Transpositions from onw position into another are possible when there are mutiple ways of reaching a certain outcome, however positions can not be reached repeatedly due to the add-on nature of the game.
