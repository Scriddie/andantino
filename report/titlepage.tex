    The goal of this project is to implement an automated game playing algorithm for the two-player board game \textit{Andantino}. For this purpose, a fully playable version of the game is implemented using a model-view-controler setup. Once this is achieved, a game playing agent based on an alpha-beta search framework is developed. The agent has to be able to take either of the two players' side and will have to make moves autonomously whilst adhering to a pre-defined time limit.
    Representations of game states are searched for optimal strategies using an enhanced version of the Negamax algorithm including iterative deepening and transposition tables. We find that those enhancements increase search depth substantially and propose further promising ideas for deeper searches and higher quality of game-play. Finally, this document contains an instruction manual describing the use of the game-playing algorithm.
