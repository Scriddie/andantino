\section{Conclusion}
Implementing the game of \textit{Andantino} in a modular MVC structure has been a successfull foundation for the development of a game-playing agent. Alpha-beta search proves to be an efficient search framework for the game. The enhancements lead to a jump in performance with notably more prunings due to the transposition table and move ordering. Iterative deepening and time management heuristics were successful in increasing the in-game performance for limited time controls and lead to a smooth degradeing in play quality as positions get more complex. The enhancement approaches used for alpha-beta search are likely to benefit from further refinement and run-time optimization. Additional components such as opening books or heuristics will no doubt improve the performance of the game-playing algorithm even further.
